    <body>
        I am a designer and art director pursuing a degree of Communications Design at Syracuse University. I am also a Marketing Minor at Whitman School of Management. I am an interdisciplinary designer with a passion for branding, packaging design, UI/UX design as well as information design. I am currently an Art Direction Intern at BARKER, an advertising agency based in New York City. I am a success scholar at Syracuse University, and I come with a variety of hard and soft skills such as leadership, communication, a team player, and a problem solver. I also have skills in the Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office as well as Google Suite. Outside of work, you will find me learning new languages, watching international TV shows, binge watching meal prep videos, and sometimes, yoga! Fun fact: I have been to about 15 countries and would love to travel to more!
